Here we go...

The 1st thing to keep in mind, is that this course is Done in Ruby as well... good that I have it installed already. 

ruby -v
ruby 3.1.3p185 (2022-11-24 revision 1a6b16756e) [x64-mingw-ucrt]

I thought I was going to manage skipping the installion of the freaking Bundler, but looks like I will need it to install the gems. 

To proceed, go with:

"gem install bundler"

bundler -v 
Bundler version 2.4.7

*important*
-------------
- After having installed bundler, "bundler" command will retrieve "Could not locate Gemfile", as you have to be in the directory where the Gemfile is located. 
    Since I have no Gemfile and I don't even know how to create one, I will move on with the course for now...
- Cucumber has to be installed too. But not yet...
