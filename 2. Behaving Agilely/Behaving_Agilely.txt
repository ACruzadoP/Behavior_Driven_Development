Let's start with the very basics of Gherkin...

The 5 Ws 
- As {who, what or where}, 
- I {want}
- because {why}


Example:

As {a user of Acme.com}
I {want to access content on my mobile phone}
because {I might not always have my computer}


THE HISTORY BEHIND
-----------------------
- There was a propototype of TDD in the 60s
- In 1976, Glenford Meyers published the book, "Software Reliability" which said that developers should not be the ones testing their code. Then QA departments
    were created and Testers and Developers went into WAR.
- Kent Beck created extreme programming (XP), from which Test-driven development (TDD) evolved.
    So TDD was introduced to developers as part ot the XP process. 
        - Kent Beck created Smalltalk's unit-testing framework (SUnit), and TDD was officially implemented. 
        - Kent Beck said that devs should write their own unit tests, one per class. 
        - Kent Beck said that the development had to start with a test, so that we know when we're done.

*The problem of TDD is that devs didn't now what to test, where to start developing or how to understand a failing test.

- Dan North then introduced BDD in 2006, with a blog post title "Introducing BDD", and published by "Better Software" magazine.
    - BDD is a mix of TDD and Agile methodology. 
    - It focuses on the behaviour that the app will have once the development has concluded. 
    - For each behavior described by Gherkin, there will be a test afterwards.
